### Coworkers are less likely to interrupt you

There's something about seeing two folks in conversation at a workstation that discourages interruptions.

### It's easier to stay in flow because the context is in two heads

If you do get interrupted, one person can stay in a flow state, and quickly bring the other back in.

### You'll be happier

If you're anything like me, it's hard to disentangle your mood from how much you got done at work.

When I pair, I get more done due to spending less time distracted or blocked. 

I finish the day tired but pleased.

### Your hands get a break

RSI is no joke. It can end careers.

Pairing lets you share the typing and put fewer miles on your tissues.
