Here's a template for your next pairing session:

<ol class="font-mono my-6">
  <li class="mt-3">[ ] Agree on the high-level goal out loud.</li>
  <li class="mt-3">[ ] Break the work into a handful of tasks and prioritize them.</li>
  <li class="mt-3">[ ] Decide your driver/navigator swapping strategy.</li>
  <li class="mt-3">[ ] Configure git to share credit.</li>
  <li class="mt-3">[ ] Eliminate distractions.</li>
  <li class="mt-3">[ ] Work.</li>
  <li class="mt-3">[ ] Analyze the session with a mini retro.</li>
</ol>

Let's talk more about each step.


## 1. Agree on the high-level goal out loud

State **out loud** what you hope to accomplish at a high level.

You wouldn't think it'd be possible for two people to start pairing without agreement about where they're headed, but it's surprisingly easy.


## 2. Break the work into a handful of tasks (and prioritize them)

It's worth trying to break your high-level goal into a handful of smaller steps.

This has a number of benefits:

- It makes the goal less intimidating.
- You'll spot dead ends and pitfalls more easily.
- You can sort your task list by priority.
- You're more likely to notice that accomplishing task C would make B easier, and reorder appropriately.
- You can decide on a task based on your current energy levels.
- It gives you a clear place to put new tasks you think of while working.

[Some folks](https://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/pair_programming.html) like
to write each task on its own index card. The stack of them lives in front of the navigator.
Each card can be a nice home for notes or ideas to bring up when there is a break in
the action.


## 3. Decide what will trigger a driver/navigator swap

Unless you already know what works best for you, I strongly recommend the Pomodoro Technique:

1. Code for 25 minutes.
2. Take a 5 minute break.
3. Switch drivers.

Other [pair programming styles](/pair-programming-guide/styles) exist if you wish to try them.


## 4. Configure git to share credit

If two of you work on some code, both your names should appear on the commit.

Here's [a handy guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors/) to configuring git appropriately.

Bonus: GitHub understands this natively and will give you both credit for the commit.

A few tools exist to make this even easier:

- [git pair](https://github.com/chrisk/git-pair)
- [git duet](https://github.com/git-duet/git-duet)
- [git-together](https://github.com/kejadlen/git-together)


## 5. Eliminate distractions

Show respect for your pair and the work you're about to do.

- Don't bring your phone. Silence it if you do.
- Disable notifications on the machine you're using to pair.
- Close email/Slack/Twitter/IRC. Never keep something distracting on a second monitor.

## 6. Work

Do the work!

Don't forget:

- *When navigating:* ask questions rather than making demands.
- *When driving:* dictate what you're doing and why.
- Err on the side of over-communication.
- Take lots of breaks.
- Swap roles frequently.
- Do the simplest thing that could possibly work (for now).
- Avoid these [pairing antipatterns](/pair-programming-guide/antipatterns).


## 7. Perform a mini retro

Spend a few minutes after your session reflecting on the experience.

First, discuss what went well.

Then, consider what would make the next session 1% better.

Possible areas for improvement:

* **Focus**: did distractions sneak in?
* **Communication**: were there long stretches of no talking?
* **Pacing**: did the session feel like a grind at any point?
* **Division of responsibility**: did you split the work up well?
* **Code quality**: was your end-product high-quality?
