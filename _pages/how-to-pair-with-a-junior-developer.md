## Understand they're scared

Most people find it intimidating to pair with someone with more experience. 

This can happen even if you're extremely friendly, or have known each other a long time.

Assume your pair is at least a bit nervous.


## Realize fear makes you dumb

A nervous person is primed for physical action, not careful logic.

When it takes your pair a little longer to spot the typo, decipher the error, or respond to your question, cut them some extra slack.


## Don't make it worse

It's extremely easy to make things worse with a careless word, sigh, or body language.

If you get frustrated or bored, its your duty to hide this fact as best you can. If you can't hide it, suggest a break.

Never drum your fingers on the desk.


## Prioritize learning over productivity

Yes, you could probably complete this task faster on your own.

If you've chosen to pair on it, it's because you are wisely prioritizing your junior's future productivity. Over the long term, leveling up a team member is worth more than completing today's task.  

If you're under too much time pressure to slow down to your pair's level, don't pair.


## Let them drive (most of the time)

If you drive, it's hard not to move too fast. Your pair won't want to tell you that they're not keeping up.


## Ask questions

* "How about we extract a method?"
* "Can we find a better way to do this?"
* "Should we take a break?"


## Admit, and lead by example

Admit when you don't know. Show them how to look it up.

Admit when you're stuck. Show them how you get unblocked.

Admit when you're tired. Show them the worthiness of breaks.
